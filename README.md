#Agent Distribution MERN App

#Project Description
The Agent Distribution MERN App is a full-stack web application that enables an Admin to manage agents and distribute uploaded leads equally among them.

Admins can:
- Securely log in with JWT authentication.
- Add and delete agents with details (name, email, mobile, password).
- Upload CSV/XLSX files containing leads.
- Automatically distribute leads equally among all active agents.
- View a history of distribution runs** and inspect leads assigned to each agent.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it ensures a smooth workflow from upload to data visualization with a responsive frontend and robust backend logic.
